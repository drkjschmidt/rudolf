INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

THIS VERSION NO LONGER ACCEPTS NMEA INPUT. INSTEAD IT DETECTS GARMIN GPS DEVICES 
DIRECTLY. DO NOT USE GARMIN SPANNER.

1. OBTAINING / UNPACKING THE DISTRIBUTION

This distribution should be available for download from 
http://www.wilsonanalytical.com/

The distribution comes in two versions:

  2010-04-05-LightPilotQB-Build-891-full.zip - LightPilot and all support software
  2010-04-05-LightPilotQB-Build-891.zip      - LightPilot installers only (for updates)

To install, extract the zip file onto a USB stick, CD, or simply a directory, 
ensuring that you retain the following directory structure:

  DumbInstaller.exe
  AUTORUN.INF
  installers/LPInstall.msi
  installers/jre-6u16-windows-i586-s.exe
  installers/lapackpp-2.5.1-setup.exe
  installers/OmniDriverSPAM_1.0_Win32_full_release.exe

If you have these files on a USB stick or a CD, inserting the stick / CD should 
autoplay the installer. If you want to install from a directory, execute the 
DumbInstaller.exe manually.

2. INSTALLATION CAVEATS

The proper functioning of this software depends on all the parts listed above 
being installed, on a recognized GPS being attached, and on the spectrometer 
driver having recognized the spectrometer (unplugging and replugging 
spectrometer should solve this problem).

The installer attempts to guide the user through the full install process and 
suggests a reboot. Please note that depending on your specific hardware, 
multiple reboots may be required. 

3. FIRST RUN

The installer creates three default directories for your data in your 
My Documents folder:

  calfile - this is where calibration curves (.cal) should be located
  spectra - this is where data files (.spm) should be located
  userloc - this is where location data (.loc) should be kept

The software will initially look in those locations but will remember your 
choice of data directories after every load and save. However, we suggest to 
keep all your data in the pre-defined directories under My Documents as this 
makes it least likely that your data will be lost.

4. FURTHER READING

For further instructions on how to use this software we suggest you consult the manual available
with your spectometer purchase from Wilson Analytical.
