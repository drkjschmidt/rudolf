INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

THIS VERSION REQUIRES A NMEA DATA SOURCE, MOST COMMONLY GARMIN SPANNER!
A SPANNER INSTALLER IS INCLUDED IN THE FULL PACKAGE BUT THE USE OF THIS
VERSION IS DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF THE NON-NMEA VERSION!

1. OBTAINING / UNPACKING THE DISTRIBUTION

This distribution should be available for download from http://www.wilsonanalytical.com/

The distribution comes in two versions:

  2010-04-05-LightPilotQB-Build-891-full.zip - LightPilot and all support software
  2010-04-05-LightPilotQB-Build-891.zip      - LightPilot installers only (for updates)

To install, extract the zip file onto a USB stick, CD, or simply a directory, ensuring that you
retain the following directory structure:

  DumbInstaller.exe
  AUTORUN.INF
  installers/LPInstall.msi

  installers/jre-6u16-windows-i586-s.exe
  installers/lapackpp-2.5.1-setup.exe
  installers/OmniDriverSPAM_1.0_Win32_full_release.exe
  installers/SpannerSetup.exe

If you have these files on a USB stick or a CD, inserting the stick / CD should autoplay the
installer. If you want to install from a directory, execute the DumbInstaller.exe manually.

2. INSTALLATION CAVEATS

The proper functioning of this software depends on all the parts listed above being installed,
on Garmin Spanner being operational and generating NMEA data, and on the spectrometer driver
having recognized the spectrometer (unplugging and replugging spectrometer should solve this
problem).

The installer attempts to guide the user through the full install process and suggests a reboot.
Please note that depending on your specific hardware, multiple reboots may be required. Please
also note that the installer attempts to create a shortcut in the Startup folder to ensure that
Spanner will be restarted on reboot, but this will only work if Spanner is installed in the
default location (C:\Garmin\Spanner.exe). If you customized the install, please fix the shortcut.

3. FIRST RUN

The installer creates three default directories for your data in your My Documents folder:

  calfile - this is where calibration curves (.cal) should be located
  spectra - this is where data files (.spm) should be located
  userloc - this is where location data (.loc) should be kept

The software will remember your default data directories but we suggest to keep all your data in
the pre-defined directories under My Documents as this makes it least likely that your data 
will be lost.

LightPilot will remember your last selection but you will have to guide it the first time.
Specifically we suggest that you should use the "Browse" option on the Customer Info Dialog (F1)
and select the Mauna Loa file provided.

4. FURTHER READING

For further instructions on how to use this software we suggest you consult the manual available
with your spectometer purchase from Wilson Analytical.
